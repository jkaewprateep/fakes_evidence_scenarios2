# Fakes evidence scenarios - 2
🧸💬 This scenario is the same as the ```auto-machine identity scenarios```, it is a ```developed scenario from a simple scenario``` that everyone may find or see in movies. Again we found in different environments we cannot protect because the attacker prepared for the ```planned scenarios``` and came with the ```potential skills```.  </br>
🦤💬 Because we are Chinese we all look the same HAHAHA!!! kidding me. Into these scenarios observe that with the number of customers and ```trust of the technologies```, there are authentication, local security policy, alarm, mirrors, observers, schedule, door open, sound speakers, and security cameras. ```Theif```know about the environment and their capabilities more than customers or sometimes employees ```trust the technologies more than their capabilities```, they are good and it is one primary tool in protection and investigation issues but there are designs and uses they ```review when some incidents occur```. </br>
🐯💬 Sometimes you can't judge from their uniform or dress but their ```working functions```, some areas of financial banking have protection levels they have ```sufficient response methods to protect belonging or process continuity``` inside the room or area they are responding to. Have you ever heard about the bulletproof control room for the working environment, there are many kinds of bulletproof and secure communication methods. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Go into it inside do you find any of a ```gold pot or saving gold ⁉️``` The secret of secure income and they like to watch the ```train rails of city construction wars is the same as selective assignment reading``` and everything has its origins </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 I will add something to this note, sometimes higher technologies create ```no contrast``` not only in the user manual and ```application adaptive compatibilities``` but fully trusting the technology may lead to ```wrong incident scenario assumption``` and making a judgment. For example, if customers drink a water bottle inside an ```automatic purchase convenience shop```, they improve the method by the initial point of products from the store's shelves, this kind of action makes it hard to prove that the ```customer's intention``` to do the incident in the ```short-term``` or they are an ```upsets employee```. </br>
👧💬 🎈 Sometimes it is simpler and police know where to find the answers 🐑💬 ➰ . . . We are Chinese we are everywhere ... </br>
👧💬 🎈 Technology, method, potential, and skills, authorization, and instruments are tools but ```external tools such as community awareness``` are something Thai's police have been leading for decades ago. </br>

## 🧸💬 Fake identity elevates to authorization

🦭💬 There is a case when someone tries to ```refund your collections rewards from your purchases``` when you are not aware of it, this is an example of tasks of convincing the store to ```identify the identity and authorization``` of the customer and rewards claim 🐑💬 ➰. 🦭💬 It is not only the reward they claim but ```information identity``` some questions of identity verification are to protect against this kind of action but with unawareness someone claim on your ```ticket or incident``` when it is urgent and priority can perform some steps with authorized or ```find some information about you```. This is an example of the contact center in a shopping mall or ```information responsibilities``` including some government information center. </br>
👤💬 ```There is concern when prank calls develop into fake identity calls and they can even develop further but it is hard to control by both sides of the purchasing and providing services```. </br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 I heard about the transfer rewards program and I can send it to you only ask for it correctly. </br>

🧸💬 Some people who create actions make mistakes understanding them and forgiveness is considering that rewards are not amounts of money even they can transfer but the method to have of their identity or perform the action plan is not quite correct. Absolutely children are initially behaviors and they can be trained, development of skills and return of good benefits from their work when we supporting them in the future. </br>
