# Fakes evidence scenarios - 2
🧸💬 This scenario is the same as the ```auto-machine identity scenarios```, it is a ```developed scenario from a simple scenario``` that everyone may find or see in movies. Again we found in different environments we cannot protect because the attacker prepared for the ```planned scenarios``` and came with the ```potential skills```.  </br>
🦤💬 Because we are Chinese we all look the same HAHAHA!!! kidding me. Into these scenarios observe that with the number of customers and ```trust of the technologies```, there are authentication, local security policy, alarm, mirrors, observers, schedule, door open, sound speakers, and security cameras. ```Theif```know about the environment and their capabilities more than customers or sometimes employees ```trust the technologies more than their capabilities```, they are good and it is one primary tool in protection and investigation issues but there are designs and uses they ```review when some incidents occur```. </br>
🐯💬 Sometimes you can't judge from their uniform or dress but their ```working functions```, some areas of financial banking have protection levels they have ```sufficient response methods to protect belonging or process continuity``` inside the room or area they are responding to. Have you ever heard about the bulletproof control room for the working environment, there are many kinds of bulletproof and secure communication methods. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Go into it inside do you find any of a ```gold pot or saving gold ⁉️``` The secret of secure income and they like to watch the ```train rails of city construction wars is the same as selective assignment reading``` and everything has its origins </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 I will add something to this note, sometimes higher technologies create ```no contrast``` not only in the user manual and ```application adaptive compatibilities``` but fully trusting the technology may lead to ```wrong incident scenario assumption``` and making a judgment. For example, if customers drink a water bottle inside an ```automatic purchase convenience shop```, they improve the method by the initial point of products from the store's shelves, this kind of action makes it hard to prove that the ```customer's intention``` to do the incident in the ```short-term``` or they are an ```upsets employee```. </br>
👧💬 🎈 Sometimes it is simpler and police know where to find the answers 🐑💬 ➰ . . . We are Chinese we are everywhere ... </br>
👧💬 🎈 Technology, method, potential, and skills, authorization, and instruments are tools but ```external tools such as community awareness``` are something Thai's police have been leading for decades ago. </br>

## 🧸💬 Fake identity elevates to authorization

🦭💬 There is a case when someone tries to ```refund your collections rewards from your purchases``` when you are not aware of it, this is an example of tasks of convincing the store to ```identify the identity and authorization``` of the customer and rewards claim 🐑💬 ➰. 🦭💬 It is not only the reward they claim but ```information identity``` some questions of identity verification are to protect against this kind of action but with unawareness someone claim on your ```ticket or incident``` when it is urgent and priority can perform some steps with authorized or ```find some information about you```. This is an example of the contact center in a shopping mall or ```information responsibilities``` including some government information center. </br>
👤💬 ```There is concern when prank calls develop into fake identity calls and they can even develop further but it is hard to control by both sides of the purchasing and providing services```. </br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 ```I heard about the transfer rewards program and I can send it to you only ask for it correctly.``` </br>

🧸💬 ```Some people who create actions make mistakes understanding them and forgiveness is considering that rewards are not amounts of money even they can transfer but the method to have of their identity or perform the action plan is not quite correct. Absolutely children are initially behaviors and they can be trained, develop skills and return of good benefits from their work when we support them in the future.``` </br>

🐑💬 ➰ Who stole from my shopping mall shelves again I will transfer them to a hacker HAHAHA!!! </br>

🦤💬 Urgent case request is a priority and we have reasons to support about it, any case should be solved even they are purchasing products or not because the community are reflection of every person in the same area. The answer is always fixed even if you are not buying anything from the shopping mall. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Background working and after the issues were solved, we worked hard to identify the incident and how to protect the fake identity authorization. We found it is a random trial from the young generation but possibly led to this kind of action because, on the end of the phone line, there is no one control them or advice. Activities, Sports, Hobbies, and Part-time jobs help them not only income and save time for parenting their busy gradients but also train in working behaviors, community reactions, and safety response awareness can communicate in this time. </br> 
🧸💬 Of course someone invented an idea 🔥🧑‍🚒🧑‍🚒 why don't we have a database of authorized people and we give them priority⁉️ 🐱💬 That is a great idea and possibility but the reason is not the mobility of the phone number and we treat people the same with authorization and community feedback also prevents fake identity drawbacks. </br>
👤💬 That kid should be police because community feedback is active even when we are sleeping, police are working 24 hours to protect people from external threats but they cannot stay with you 24 hours but community feedback can. Do not lower estimates of the power of the harmonics community that is not only a safety issue but in many ways of supporting. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ That PASTA case in Thailand we organized already and they integrated to this level. </br>

## 🧸💬 Known environment scenario

🐐💬 ```IT networks activities```, common programmers or computer experts know DNS servers, communication servers, and database servers but they do not know about the ```application workflow```, ```security setup standards```, ```connectivity```, ```response policy```, ```address```, or ```identity``` when this information is used every day by IT administrator in the control room and some employees. How to protect this information from external users. There are many solutions that may suit your environment after policy such as ```naming conveniences```, ```no temporary tables```, ```secured```, ```secured communications channels```, ```virtual environment```, ```action tracking```, and ```authority levels responsiveness```. </br>
🦭💬 Users need to understand there is a weight between the conveniences and security, and in application solution design they need to ```weight of convenience``` use ( by programmer and system integrators ) and security because of protection and steps to access secured databases records are also protected from external but sometimes it slow down project because we need to build the same technology matching in case of they are not the same with in standard or need organize of the ```same tools when the project initial``` 👤💬 ```Into this part integration test and test system environments had perform test run before solution confirm and complete the drawing diagrams``` </br>

🦤💬 There are systems to respond with ```high accuracy and system design``` to create instant actions, mapping to the known system is a database query and node.js application routes in Apache Spark, Load balancing, and Nginx proxy server. By ```application workflow logic``` it needs to complete the process that may contain customer information, working on the ```application tracking```, ```verification results```, and ```customer responses``` and ```feedback with the high accuracy as possible```. This logic is simple and powerful when external development methods interrupt this process ( mostly random and finding possible attached points to create some benefits for some user or group of users ) </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 That is because it is true logic and we do not modify the true logic or we need to rebuild them, development of ```protection responsive actions``` baed on this scenario is the zoning of ```sensitive information services``` inside the organization and ```routing services``` and ```instant response service``` to outside of the organization as attaches points with ```multiple secured communication methods```. By the ```business requirements``` expansion of branches, applications and auto-machine they develop of business competitive when also develop of ```secured communications```. </br>

🧸💬 ```Not only authentication but stageless communication and secured communication reduced distributed message communication inside IT organized solution by half, sometimes distributed communications refer to unknown source destination or order message returns.``` </br>
🦭💬 We can have a small application logic to find the order of communication and summing of message sequence order or summing of request references success output for ```IT networks monitoring```, at the end of the day someone monitoring the system has responsibility ```assigned his allowance to system item communication and message generated to application owner for statistics and IT networks risks found in the solution```. </br>

    <b> Known environment scenario </b>
</p>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 There are some examples of using ```power-series``` and I know some applications working in this scenario, he tried to build ```message detection to filters``` for distributed messages for the organization by ```assignment to correct threads actions to the response```. These are application-based scenarios by identifying of input and mapping to assign to the output, there are short-time effects, sequence action effects, and ```instant effects``` and this method heddles best with the short-time action effects. </br>
🦤💬 That is because ```IT network data is repeating data and requires data transformation same as speech data``` to help reduce processor working and finish working process time within the time requirements. Machine learning to help with this issue is not winning humans in this scenario because of changes in the ```environment and input design```. Simply input can be DateTime, sample message pattern, or summarizing of the system communication statistics by the workflow process but machine learning can identify message types and expectations. This system is implemented and running and connectivity is monitored by this system with notification method and responsive actions to organize message input /output and message routings. ```👤💬 Application routing auto-response application needs to know about this application routing system sometimes find blocked or delayed messages you should visit him once.``` </br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 I recognized he had a smart case that may have come from the mission impossible and that is not only IVR accumulate counting money balance amount but facsimile communication as natural encryption message. </br>

🥺💬 👤💬 By my intention added some pictures or objects that may be found in web applications ```.JSON``` is from his requirements because he controls communication message logging but not IT routing network. </br>
